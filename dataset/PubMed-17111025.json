The incidence of BS is high in male vs. female (i.e., 8-10/1: male/female). The disorder is caused by mutations in the SCN5A gene encoding Nav1.5, the cardiac sodium channel, which is the only gene in which mutations were found to cause the disease. Mutations in SCN5A associated with the BS phenotype usually result in a loss of channel function by a reduction in Na+ currents. We review the clinical aspects, risk stratification, and therapeutic management of this important syndrome.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":86,"end":102},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":654,"end":663},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":667,"end":672},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":693,"end":695},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":726,"end":730},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":734,"end":750},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":756,"end":765},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":769,"end":781},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"}]}
