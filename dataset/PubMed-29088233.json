Patients with LS have an increased risk of early onset colon and endometrial cancer, but also other tumors that generally have an earlier onset compared to the general population. However, age at first primary cancer varies within families and genetic anticipation, i.e. decreasing age at onset in successive generations, has been suggested in LS. Anticipation is a well-known phenomenon in e.g neurodegenerative diseases and several reports have studied anticipation in heritable cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine whether anticipation can be shown in a nationwide cohort of Swedish LS families referred to the regional departments of clinical genetics in Lund, Stockholm, Link\u00f6ping, Uppsala and Ume\u00e5 between the years 1990-2013. We analyzed a homogenous group of mutation carriers, utilizing information from both affected and non-affected family members. In total, 239 families with a mismatch repair gene mutation (96 MLH1 families, 90 MSH2 families including one family with an EPCAM-MSH2 deletion, 39 MSH6 families, 12 PMS2 families, and 2 MLH1+PMS2 families) comprising 1028 at-risk carriers were identified among the Swedish LS families, of which 1003 mutation carriers had available follow-up information and could be included in the study. Using a normal random effects model (NREM) we estimate a 2.1 year decrease in age of diagnosis per generation. An alternative analysis using a mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards model (COX-R) estimates a hazard ratio of exp(0.171), or about 1.19, for age of diagnosis between consecutive generations. LS-associated gene-specific anticipation effects are evident for MSH2 (2.6 years/generation for NREM and hazard ratio of 1.33 for COX-R) and PMS2 (7.3 years/generation and hazard ratio of 1.86). The estimated anticipation effects for MLH1 and MSH6 are smaller.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":116,"end":130},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":136,"end":145},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":146,"end":155},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":185,"end":189},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":191,"end":195},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":197,"end":201},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":205,"end":209},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T7"}]}
