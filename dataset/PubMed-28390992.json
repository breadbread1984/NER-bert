We recently identified novel hypomorphic mutations in the tRNA Nucleotidyl Transferase, CCA-Adding 1 (TRNT1) gene that cause early-onset RP. To model this disease in vitro, we generated patient-specific iPSCs and iPSC-derived retinal organoids from dermal fibroblasts of patients with molecularly confirmed TRNT1-associated RP. Pluripotency was confirmed using rt-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and a TaqMan Scorecard Assay. Mutations in TRNT1 caused reduced levels of full-length TRNT1 protein and expression of a truncated smaller protein in both patient-specific iPSCs and iPSC-derived retinal organoids. Patient-specific iPSCs and iPSC-derived retinal organoids exhibited a deficit in autophagy, as evidenced by aberrant accumulation of LC3-II and elevated levels of oxidative stress. Autologous stem cell-based disease modeling will provide a platform for testing multiple avenues of treatment in patients suffering from TRNT1-associated RP.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":122,"end":142},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":341,"end":350},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":402,"end":407},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":419,"end":424},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":437,"end":439},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":720,"end":729},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":733,"end":738},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":746,"end":753},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":754,"end":775},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":776,"end":781},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":782,"end":789},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":794,"end":827},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":828,"end":835},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T12"}]}
