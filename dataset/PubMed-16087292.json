Children affected with this disease tend to develop normally for the first 5 years of life. However, once disease onset occurs, they decline rapidly and die in their late 20s to early 30s. Though this represents the typical disease course, the onset and severity of disease symptoms can vary. This variability is presumed to be the result of both differences in the causative genetic mutation in the CLN3 gene as well as environmental influences. Most cases of JNCL are caused by a 1 kb deletion in the CLN3 gene, resulting in a frameshift mutation predicted to leave the first 153 amino acids of the CLN3 protein intact, followed by the addition of 28 novel amino acids. Here we report the discovery of a novel mutation identified as a G to T transversion at nucleotide 49 (G49T) in exon 2 of CLN3, introducing a premature stop codon (E17X) near the N-terminus. This mutation represents the most 5' mutation described to date. The patient examined in this study was heterozygous for the common 1 kb deletion and E17X. She had classical disease progression, suggesting that this mutation in CLN3 mimics the more prevalent 1 kb deletion and that progression of JNCL is predominantly the result of loss of CLN3 function.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":6,"end":10},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":11,"end":19},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":48,"end":52},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":56,"end":63},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":64,"end":72},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":119,"end":158},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":795,"end":799},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":804,"end":813},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":821,"end":829},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":837,"end":841},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":848,"end":860},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":863,"end":882},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1109,"end":1113},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1128,"end":1132},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1134,"end":1145},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1170,"end":1174},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"}]}
