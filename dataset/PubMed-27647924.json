Deficiency of this enzyme has not been described previously. We report an 8-y-old male with intermittently elevated transaminase levels, liver fibrosis, mild ataxia, and cognitive impairment. Exome sequencing revealed a previously unidentified homozygous premature termination mutation (p.Y69*) in ACOX2 Immunohistochemistry confirmed the absence of ACOX2 expression in the patient's liver, and biochemical analysis showed marked elevation of intermediate bile acids upstream of ACOX2. These findings define a potentially treatable inborn error of bile acid biosynthesis caused by ACOX2 deficiency.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":608,"end":614},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":619,"end":624},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":660,"end":667},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":671,"end":676},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":677,"end":687},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":751,"end":760},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":764,"end":787},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"}]}
