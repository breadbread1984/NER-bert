This disorder is rare in the general population except in Finland. Since the most characteristic feature of this disorder is a progressive developmental regression, patients often show no specific symptoms in the initial stages, and thus early diagnosis is often challenging.\nCASE REPORT: We encountered a 16-year-old boy who began to show difficulties in his speech at the age of 6years. Due to a mild regression in his development, he gradually lost common daily abilities. His diagnosis was first obtained through exome sequencing that identified a novel homozygous mutation in the AGA gene. This result was reasonable because of parental consanguinity. Reduced enzymatic activity of AGA was then confirmed. His urine was retrospectively screened by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and a specific pattern of abnormal metabolites was identified.\nCONCLUSIONS: Because both exome sequencing and MALDI-TOF-MS screening are adaptable and comprehensive, future combinatory use of these methods would be useful for diagnosis of rare inborn errors of metabolism such as AGU.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":22},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":23,"end":32},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":52,"end":60},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":68,"end":71},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}]}
