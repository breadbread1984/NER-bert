However, the mechanisms underlying irreversible neuroaxonal degeneration in multiple sclerosis and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are not well understood. A long-standing hypothesis holds that the distribution of voltage-gated sodium channels along demyelinated axons contributes to neurodegeneration by increasing neuroaxonal sodium influx and energy demand during CNS inflammation. Here, we tested this hypothesis in vivo by inserting a human gain-of-function mutation in the mouse NaV1.2-encoding gene Scn2a that is known to increase NaV1.2-mediated persistent sodium currents. In mutant mice, CNS inflammation during EAE leads to elevated neuroaxonal degeneration and increased disability and lethality compared with wild-type littermate controls. Importantly, immune cell infiltrates were not different between mutant EAE mice and wild-type EAE mice. Thus, this study shows that increased neuronal NaV1.2 activity exacerbates inflammation-induced neurodegeneration irrespective of immune cell alterations and identifies NaV1.2 as a promising neuroprotective drug target in multiple sclerosis.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":720,"end":736},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":737,"end":745},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":780,"end":785},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":872,"end":899},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":909,"end":917},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":918,"end":942},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":947,"end":956},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":957,"end":967},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":972,"end":981},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"}]}
