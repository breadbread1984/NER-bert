DYT1 is caused by mutations of the TOR1A gene, located on 9q34, which causes dysfunction of the D1 direct pathway or the indirect pathway. Dysfunction of the former causes postural-type and segmental dystonia; the latter causes action-type dystonia. In families with action-type dystonia, there are cases with focal and segmental dystonia. Ages of onset of postural-type dystonia are around 6 years, and 8 to 10 years in cases of action-type dystonia. Focal and segmental dystonia develops in the teens. Mental and psychological functions are preserved. DYT5 is caused by heterozygous mutations of the GCH1 gene, located on 14q22.1-q22.2. Again, mental and psychological functions are preserved. Clinically, there are two types: postural and action. Postural-type dystonia occurs around 6 years of age, with postural dystonia of one leg, and all extremities and trunk muscles are involved by the late teens. Action-type dystonia shows dystonic movements from around 8 to 10 years of age. In both types, all symptoms show diurnal fluctuations that diminish with age and are no longer apparent in the late teens. L-dopa produces dramatic effects, which continue throughout the course of the illness. In both postural and action types, each family or sporadic case has a particular mutation. It remains unclear why specific mutations cause certain age- and gender-specific symptoms.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":149,"end":153},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":157,"end":166},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":167,"end":176},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":184,"end":189},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":226,"end":237},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":245,"end":262},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":270,"end":286},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":321,"end":357},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":377,"end":397},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":703,"end":707},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":711,"end":720},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":734,"end":743},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":751,"end":755},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"}]}
