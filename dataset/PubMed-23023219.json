In this study, ARSB mutation analysis was performed on three unrelated patients who were originally from the West Azerbaijan province of Iran.\nMETHODS: After PCR and direct DNA sequencing, DNA extraction was performed.\nRESULTS: Sequencing analysis revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation in the ARSB gene at c.1457A\u003CG [p. D486V] in three unrelated Iranian MPS-VI patients with different phenotype severity.\nCONCLUSION: The mutation type in three patients was the same; probably, because of a foundation effect on their population.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":26,"end":46},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":47,"end":55},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":56,"end":58},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":83,"end":112},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":169,"end":198},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":261,"end":273},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":278,"end":288},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":292,"end":325},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":344,"end":352},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":361,"end":370},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":371,"end":383},"obj":"PosReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"}]}
