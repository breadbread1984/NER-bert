In this study, we report the identification of 13 variants and three polymorphisms in the FLCN gene in 143 Danish patients or families with suspected BHD syndrome. Functional mini-gene splicing analysis revealed that two intronic variants (c.1062+2T\u003EG and c.1177-5_1177-3del) introduced splicing aberrations. Eleven families exhibited the c.1062+2T\u003EG mutation. Combined single nucleotide polymorphism array-haplotype analysis showed that these families share a 3-Mb genomic fragment containing the FLCN gene, revealing that the c.1062+2T\u003EG mutation is a Danish founder mutation. On the basis of in silico prediction and functional splicing assays, we classify the 16 identified variants in the FLCN gene as follows: nine as pathogenic, one as likely pathogenic, three as likely benign and three as polymorphisms. In conclusion, the study describes the FLCN mutation spectrum in Danish BHD patients, and contributes to a better understanding of BHD syndrome and management of BHD patients.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":114,"end":123},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":143,"end":147},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":182,"end":184},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":185,"end":199},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"}]}
