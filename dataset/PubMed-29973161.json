To date, nearly 170 mutations of HEXA have been described, including only one 7.6\u00a0kb large deletion.\nMETHODS: Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) study was carried out in 5 unrelated patients for copy number changes where heterozygous and/or homozygous disease causing mutation/s could not be identified in the coding region by sequencing of HEXA gene.\nRESULTS: The study has identified the presence of a homozygous deletion of exon-2 and exon-3 in two patients, two patient showed compound heterozygosity with exon 1 deletion combined with missense mutation p.E462V and one patient was identified with duplication of exon-1 with novel variants c.1527-2A \u003E T as a second allele.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first report of deletion/duplication in HEXA gene providing a new insight into the molecular basis of TSD and use of MLPA assay for detecting large copy number changes in the HEXA gene.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":18,"end":38},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":42,"end":46},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":69,"end":73},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":74,"end":91},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":116,"end":133},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":175,"end":184},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":185,"end":194},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":202,"end":206},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"}]}
