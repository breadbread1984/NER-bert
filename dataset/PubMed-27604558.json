It encodes a transcription factor implicated in the skeletal growth. Point mutations, deletions or duplications of SHOX or its transcriptional regulatory elements are associated with two skeletal dysplasias, L\u00e9ri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD) and Langer mesomelic dysplasia (LMD), as well as in a small proportion of idiopathic short stature (ISS) individuals. We have identified a total of 15 partial SHOX deletions and 13 partial SHOX duplications in LWD, LMD and ISS patients referred for routine SHOX diagnostics during a 10 year period (2004-2014). Subsequently, we characterized these alterations using MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay), fine-tiling array CGH (comparative genomic hybridation) and breakpoint PCR. Nearly half of the alterations have a distal or proximal breakpoint in intron 3. Evaluation of our data and that in the literature reveals that although partial deletions and duplications only account for a small fraction of SHOX alterations, intron 3 appears to be a breakpoint hotspot, with alterations arising by non-allelic homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining or other complex mechanisms.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":322,"end":337},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":339,"end":348},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":352,"end":364},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":368,"end":372},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":420,"end":430},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":461,"end":489},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":500,"end":526},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":570,"end":594},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T4"}]}
