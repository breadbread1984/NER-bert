Classic porokeratosis of Mibelli (PM) frequently appears in childhood with a risk of malignant transformation. Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is the most common subtype of porokeratosis with genetic heterogeneities, and mevalonate kinase gene (MVK) mutations have been identified in minor portion of DSAP families of Chinese origin. To confirm the previous findings about MVK mutations in DSAP patients and test MVK's role(s) in PM development, we performed genomic sequence analysis for 3 DSAP families and 1 PM family of Chinese origin. We identified a splicing mutation of MVK gene, designated as c.1039+1G\u003EA, in the PM family. No MVK mutations were found in three DSAP families. Sequence analysis for complementary DNA templates from PM lesions of all patients revealed a mutation at splice donor site of intron 10, designated as c.1039+1G\u003EA, leading to the splicing defect and termination codon 52 amino acids after exon 10. Although no MVK mutations in DSAP patients were found as reported previously, we identified MVK simultaneously responsible for PM development.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":17},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":21,"end":24},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":30,"end":35},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":39,"end":63},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1091},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1093,"end":1103},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1108,"end":1123},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1128,"end":1145},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"}]}
