This gene codes for dystrophin, a protein important for maintaining the stability of muscle-fiber membranes. In 1988, Monaco and colleagues postulated an explanation for the phenotypic difference between Duchenne and Becker patients in the reading-frame rule: In Duchenne patients, mutations induce a shift in the reading frame leading to prematurely truncated, dysfunctional dystrophins. In Becker patients, in-frame mutations allow the synthesis of internally deleted, but largely functional dystrophins. Currently, over 4700 mutations have been reported in the Leiden DMD mutation database, of which 91% are in agreement with this rule. In this study we provide an update of the mutational variability in the DMD gene, particularly focusing on genotype-phenotype correlations and mutations that appear to be exceptions to the reading-frame rule.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":169,"end":177},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":189,"end":214},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":224,"end":233},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":234,"end":243},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":251,"end":254},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":524,"end":532},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":543,"end":552},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":553,"end":559},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":560,"end":588},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":589,"end":596},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":600,"end":621},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":623,"end":636},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":637,"end":648},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":653,"end":659},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":670,"end":688},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":689,"end":694},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":699,"end":730},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":736,"end":754},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":755,"end":766},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R14","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R17","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"}]}
