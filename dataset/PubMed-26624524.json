Previously we reported enhanced proliferative activity associated with the activation of WNT5A/CDK6/pRb signalling in PGRN-deficient cells. The objective of this work was to elucidate the association between PGRN deficiency, WNT5A signalling and cell proliferation in immortalized lymphoblasts from carriers of the c.709-1G \u003E A GRN mutation (asymptomatic and FTLD-TDP).\nMETHODS: We assessed cell proliferation in carriers of the c.709-1G \u003E A GRN gene mutation and controls without GRN mutation and without sign of neurologic degeneration by cell counting or using an MTT assay. We used a luciferase assay to measure the nuclear factor-\u03ba (NF-\u03ba) activity. We evaluated messenger RNA levels using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and protein levels by immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to analyze the interaction between PGRN and its receptors.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 19 carriers of the GRN gene mutation and 10 controls in this study. The PGRN-deficient cells showed increased expression of WNT5A due to NF-\u03baB signalling overactivation. We observed a competition between PGRN and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) for binding both TNF receptors (TNFR) I and II. Blocking NF-\u03baB signalling using wedelolactone or specific antibodies against TNFRs inhibited WNT5A overexpression and proliferation of PGRN-deficient cells. Conversely, the activation of NF-\u03baB signalling by TNF-\u03b1 increased WNT5A-dependent proliferation of control cells.\nLIMITATIONS: All cell lines were derived from individuals harboring the same splicing GRN mutation. Nevertheless, most of the known GRN mutations lead to haploinsufficiency of the protein.\nCONCLUSION: Our results revealed an important role of NF-\u03baB signalling in PGRN-associated FTLD-TDP and confirm that PGRN can bind to TNF-a receptors regulating the expression of WNT5A, suggesting novel targets for treatment of FTLD-TDP linked to GRN mutations.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":186,"end":202},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":221,"end":224},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":226,"end":235},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":279,"end":312},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1533,"end":1537},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1538,"end":1547},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1561,"end":1570},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1571,"end":1581},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1585,"end":1590},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1598,"end":1614},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1615,"end":1629},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":2158,"end":2161},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":2162,"end":2171},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":2172,"end":2179},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":2180,"end":2198},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":2206,"end":2213},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"}]}
