The purpose of this study was, by examining the electrophysiological responses of the retina, to evaluate the capacity of recovery of the whole retinal area and different cell types induced by extremely prolonged dark adaptation (DA) in BD disease and to gain further understanding of the pathogenesis of BD. Six young patients underwent bilateral full-field ERGs after 24 h of DA in one eye and standard DA in the fellow eye. The results were also compared with the effect of prolonged DA (10 h), previously studied in the same patients. After extremely prolonged DA (24 h) the rod b-wave and the mixed rod-cone a-wave responses reached normal though delayed amplitudes. An increase, up to normal level, in the oscillatory response was found. There was no obvious recovery of the cone response. We conclude that in young BD patients during extremely prolonged DA there is a significant additional capacity of recovery of rod function and also significant gain of activity in the inner retinal layer. A continuous but slow regeneration of rod photopigment seems to occur at least up to 24 h. The visual process in the RPE is retarded and CRALBP acts in this process; also, the M\u00fcller cells of the retina seem to be involved. The findings also support an extremely slow synthesis of photopigments and irreversibly disturbed cone function early in BD.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":123,"end":140},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":208,"end":217},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":240,"end":245},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":289,"end":295},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"}]}
