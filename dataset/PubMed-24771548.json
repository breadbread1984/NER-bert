Disease onset varied with gender, occurring in male children and adult women. Exome sequence analyses revealed a novel mutation (c.1490C\u003ET, p.P497L) in the ubiquilin-2 gene (UBQLN2) with X-linked inheritance in all studied affected individuals. As ubiquilin-2-positive inclusions were identified in brain, we suggest that mutant peptide predisposes to protein misfolding and accumulation. Our findings expand the spectrum of neurodegenerative phenotypes caused by UBQLN2 mutations.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":7,"end":15},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":16,"end":23},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":24,"end":73},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":684,"end":690},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":699,"end":713},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":714,"end":721},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":722,"end":732},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":737,"end":749},"obj":"PosReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"}]}
