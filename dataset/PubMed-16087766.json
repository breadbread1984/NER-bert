A muscle biopsy specimen was obtained and studied by immunohistochemistry. Genetic analysis was performed using single-stranded conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing of genomic DNA.\nRESULTS: All the patients presented the R1905X mutation in the DYSF gene in homozygosity, and the haplotype analysis at the DYSF locus revealed that it was a novel and founder mutation. A C-to-T transition at nucleotide position 6086 changes an arginine into a stop codon, leading to premature termination of translation. This mutation was expressed as 3 different clinical phenotypes (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, Miyoshi distal myopathy, and distal anterior dysferlinopathy), but only 1 phenotype was found in the same family.\nCONCLUSIONS: The new R1905X DYSF founder mutation produced the 3 possible dysferlinopathy phenotypes without intrafamilial heterogeneity. This homogeneous population in Sueca, Spain, should be helpful in studying the modifying factors responsible for the phenotypic variability.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":128,"end":137},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":156,"end":160},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":167,"end":172},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":221,"end":237},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":239,"end":277},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":283,"end":319},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":904,"end":921},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":989,"end":999},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1000,"end":1036},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"}]}
