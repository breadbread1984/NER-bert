Dystrophinopathies show a complex mutation spectrum. The importance of mutation databases, with clinical phenotypes and protein studies of patients, is increasingly recognized as a reference for genetic diagnosis and for the development of gene therapy.\nMETHODS: We used the data from the Japanese Registry of Muscular Dystrophy (Remudy) compiled during from July 2009 to March 2017, and reviewed 1497 patients with dystrophinopathies.\nRESULTS: The spectrum of identified mutations contained exon deletions (61%), exon duplications (13%), nonsense mutations (13%), small deletions (5%), small insertions (3%), splice-site mutations (4%), and missense mutations (1%). Exon deletions were found most frequently in the central hot spot region between exons 45-52 (42%), and most duplications were detected in the proximal hot spot region between exons 3-25 (47%). In the 371 patients harboring a small mutation, 194 mutations were reported and 187 mutations were unreported.\nCONCLUSIONS: We report the largest dystrophinopathies mutation dataset in Japan from a national patient registry, \"Remudy\". This dataset provides a useful reference to support the genetic diagnosis and treatment of dystrophinopathy.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":89,"end":116},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":162,"end":171},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":172,"end":181},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":189,"end":192},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"}]}
