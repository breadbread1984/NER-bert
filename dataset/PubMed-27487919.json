J Inherit Metab Dis 21:191-194, 1998). The typical clinical picture is characterized by hepatorenal glycogen accumulation resulting in hepato- and nephromegaly, impaired utilization of glucose and galactose, proximal renal tubular dysfunction, rickets and severe short stature.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report 2 Palestinian patients from 2 families who were homozygous for the mutation p.R301X (C\u003ET) in exon 7of GLUT2 gene. Patient 1 showed clinical and laboratory improvement with age characterized by normal growth and resolution of rickets. Patient 2 had severe phenotype characterized by progressive weight loss, persistent metabolic acidosis, marked polyuria and clinical and laboratory findings of rickets progressing to death at age 10\u00a0months.\nCONCLUSION: This report further expands the clinical spectrum of FBS even with identical mutations. Other yet unknown genetic, environmental or stochastic factors may be responsible for phenotypic variability.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":120,"end":143},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":201,"end":210},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":213,"end":223},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":250,"end":255},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"}]}
