Upon sequence analysis, a point mutation within exon 4 of the SEDL gene (c.239A to G) was found which resulted in substitution of histidine with arginine at codon 80 (His80Arg).\nCONCLUSION: A novel missense mutation (H80R) was identified for SEDL gene in the large Chinese SEDT pedigree.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":9,"end":17},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":25,"end":29},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":35,"end":45},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":46,"end":89},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":655,"end":659},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":666,"end":677},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":695,"end":706},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":760,"end":768},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"}]}
