We carried out a genetic study on a child who was suspected clinically to have KFSD. Sanger sequencing was performed to detect mutations in the entire coding region of MBTPS2. A novel missense mutation (c.599C\u003ET) was identified in the patient, confirming a diagnosis of KFSD. We reviewed related cases with MBTPS2 mutations for evidence of genotype-phenotype correlations.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":6,"end":12},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":13,"end":30},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":31,"end":37},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":40,"end":82},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":140,"end":182},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":296,"end":305},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":306,"end":315},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":323,"end":329},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":539,"end":547},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":580,"end":590},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":606,"end":610},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"}]}
