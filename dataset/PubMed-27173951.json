More rarely, HH can feature in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a congenital overgrowth disorder, resulting from defects at a differentially methylated region telomeric to the K-ATP channel genes at chromosome 11p15.5.\nSUBJECT: We undertook genetic testing in a patient with diazoxide-unresponsive HH diagnosed at birth. Physical examination later revealed hemihypertrophy of the right arm, a feature of BWS.\nRESULTS: We identified a novel mosaic, paternally-inherited KCNJ11 mutation(s) in the patient. Further analysis confirmed uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 11, which extended across the KCNJ11 gene at 11p15.1 and the BWS locus at 11p15.5.\nCONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of considering UPD as a mechanism of disease in patients with HH and a paternally inherited K-ATP channel mutation, especially when additional syndromic features are present.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":157,"end":188},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":203,"end":215},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":216,"end":247},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":255,"end":260},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":265,"end":271},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"}]}
