Mutations in VMA21 result in insufficient lysosome acidification, causing progressive proximal weakness with onset before age 20 years and loss of ambulation by middle age.\nMETHODS: We describe a patient with onset of slowly progressive proximal weakness of the lower limbs after age 50, who maintains ambulation with the assistance of a cane at age 71.\nRESULTS: Muscle biopsy at age 66 showed complex muscle fiber splitting, internalized capillaries, and vacuolar changes characteristic of autophagic vacuolar myopathy. Vacuoles stained positive for sarcolemmal proteins, LAMP2, and complement C5b-9. Ultrastructural evaluation further revealed basal lamina reduplication and extensive autophagosome extrusion. Sanger sequencing identified a known pathologic splice site mutation in VMA21 (c.164-7T\u003EG).\nCONCLUSIONS: This case expands the clinical phenotype of XMEA and suggests VMA21 sequencing be considered in evaluating men with LAMP2-positive autophagic vacuolar myopathy.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":78,"end":120},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":195,"end":204},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":208,"end":213},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":224,"end":236},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":237,"end":259},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":261,"end":268},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":269,"end":298},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"}]}
