Here we describe a 35-years-old who experienced progressive muscle weakness. The muscle biopsy revealed an unspecific pattern of atrophic and hypertrophic fibers; the immunohistochemistry for several proteins was normal. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis showed a heterozygous deletion of the entire TRIM32 gene. On the other allele we identified the R316X nonsense mutation. The genetic diagnosis of LGMD2H in this case was reached by using a novel high throughput diagnostic tool.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":15,"end":45},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":46,"end":53},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":56,"end":62},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":63,"end":71},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":156,"end":189},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":268,"end":277},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":278,"end":287},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":295,"end":301},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"}]}
