The 786-O, A498, and RCC4 cell lines were used to investigate the mechanisms of PD-L1 regulation.\nOUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Fisher's exact test was used for VHL mutation and Kruskal-Wallis test for PD-L1 expression. If no covariate accounted for the association of VHL and PD-L1, then a Kruskal-Wallis test was used; otherwise Cochran-Mantel-Haenzsel test was used. We also used the Fligner-Policello test to compare two medians when the distributions had different dispersions.\nRESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We demonstrated that tumors from ccRCC patients with VHL biallelic inactivation (ie, loss of function) display a significant increase in PD-L1 expression compared with ccRCC tumors carrying one VHL wild-type allele. Using the inducible VHL 786-O-derived cell lines with varying hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2\u03b1) stabilization levels, we showed that PD-L1 expression levels positively correlate with VHL mutation and HIF-2\u03b1 expression. Targeting HIF-2\u03b1 decreased PD-L1, while HIF-2\u03b1 overexpression increased PD-L1 mRNA and protein levels in ccRCC cells. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays revealed a direct binding of HIF-2\u03b1 to a transcriptionally active hypoxia-response element in the human PD-L1 proximal promoter in 786-O cells.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our work provides the first evidence that VHL mutations positively correlate with PD-L1 expression in ccRCC and may influence the response to ccRCC anti-PD-L1/PD-1 immunotherapy.\nPATIENT SUMMARY: We investigated the relationship between von Hippel-Lindau mutations and programmed death-ligand 1 expression. We demonstrated that von Hippel-Lindau mutation status significantly correlated with programmed death-ligand 1 expression in clear cell renal cell carcinomas.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1265,"end":1268},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1279,"end":1291},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1337,"end":1345},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1349,"end":1354},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1365},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1569,"end":1574},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1575,"end":1592},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1604,"end":1613},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1619,"end":1622},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1623,"end":1631},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":2039,"end":2042},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":2043,"end":2052},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":2064,"end":2073},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":2079,"end":2084},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":2085,"end":2095},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":2113,"end":2122},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":2127,"end":2174},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":2325,"end":2342},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":2343,"end":2351},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":2373,"end":2383},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":2389,"end":2425},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"}]}
