We investigated the molecular background of antithrombin deficiency in a single centre family cohort study. We included a total of 21 families comprising 15 original probands and sixty-six relatives, 6 of who were surrogate probands for the genetic analysis. Antithrombin activity and antigen levels were measured. The heparin-antithrombin binding ratio assay was used to distinguish between the different subtypes of type II antithrombin deficiency. SERPINC1 mutations were detected by direct sequencing of all 7 exons and regulatory regions, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Eighty-six per cent of the families had a detrimental SERPINC1 gene mutation that segregated in the family. We detected 13 different SERPINC1 gene mutations of which 5 were novel. Among all these mutations, 44% was associated with type I deficiency, whereas the remainder was associated with type II heparin binding site (11%), type II pleiotropic effect (33%), type II reactive site (6%) or had the antithrombin Cambridge II mutation (6%). The current study reports several novel SERPINC1 mutations, thereby adding to our knowledge of the molecular background of antithrombin deficiency. Finally, our results point out the importance of future research outside the conventional SERPINC1 gene approach.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":8},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":23},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":24,"end":26},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":27,"end":50},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":98,"end":121},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":129,"end":141},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":142,"end":151},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":165,"end":173},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"}]}
