The ABCA4 protein is expressed in photoreceptors and possibly functions as a transporter for N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (N-retinylidene-PE), the Schiff base adduct of all-trans-retinal with PE. Mutations in the ABCA4 gene have been initially associated with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. Subsequent studies have shown that mutations in ABCA4 can also cause a variety of other retinal dystrophies including cone rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa. To determine the prevalence and mutation spectrum of ABCA4 gene mutations in non-Stargardt phenotypes, we have screened 64 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive cone (arCD) and cone rod dystrophy (arCRD) applying the Asper Ophthalmics ABCR400 microarray followed by DNA sequencing of all coding exons of the ABCA4 gene in subjects with single heterozygous mutations. Disease-associated ABCA4 alleles were identified in 20 of 64 patients with arCD or arCRD. In four of 64 patients (6%) only one mutant ABCA4 allele was detected and in 16 patients (25%), mutations on both ABCA4 alleles were identified. Based on these data we estimate a prevalence of 31% for ABCA4 mutations in arCD and arCRD, supporting the concept that the ABCA4 gene is a major locus for various types of degenerative retinal diseases with abnormalities in cone or both cone and rod function.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":445,"end":454},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":462,"end":467},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":493,"end":508},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":529,"end":546},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":583,"end":592},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":596,"end":601},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":611,"end":616},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":636,"end":655},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":666,"end":684},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":689,"end":709},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T7"}]}
