More than 80% of previously reported patients are of Finnish origin in whom a founder mutation in the TRIM37 gene have been described. We report on a 7-year-old Turkish boy who presented with classical phenotypic features of mulibrey nanism. Mutation screening of the TRIM37 gene revealed that the proband had a homozygous two base pair deletion, c.1894_1895delGA, resulting in a frame-shift and a premature termination codon. Our proband is one of the rare examples of mulibrey nanism outside Finland and extends the mutation spectrum in this disorder.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":8,"end":16},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":20,"end":26},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":30,"end":45},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":46,"end":61},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":632,"end":648},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":650,"end":662},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":665,"end":676},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":683,"end":704},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"}]}
