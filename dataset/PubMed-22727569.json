The aim of this study was to screen DNA samples from 16 Chinese MSUD patients and assess a potential correlation between genotype and phenotype.\nMETHODS: BCKDHA, BCKDHB and DBT genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Segments bearing novel mutations were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis.\nRESULTS: Within the variant alleles, 28 mutations (28/32, 87.5%), were detected in 15 patients, while one patient displayed no mutations. Mutations were comprised of 20 different: 6 BCKDHA gene mutations in 4 cases, 10 BCKDHB gene mutations in 8 cases and 4 DBT gene mutations in 3 cases. From these, 14 were novel, which included 3 mutations in the BCKDHA gene, 7 in the BCKDHB gene and 4 in the DBT gene. Only two patients with mutations in the BCKDHB and DBT genes were thiamine-responsive and presented a better clinical outcome.\nCONCLUSION: We identified 20 different mutations within the BCKDHA, BCKDHB and DBT genes among 16 Chinese MSUD patients, including 14 novel mutations. The majority were non-responsive to thiamine, associating with a worse clinical outcome. Our data provide the basis for further genotype-phenotype correlation studies in these patients, which will be beneficial for early diagnosis and in directing the approach to clinical intervention.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":90,"end":115},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":140,"end":149},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":150,"end":159},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":167,"end":173},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":175,"end":181},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":186,"end":189},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T3"}]}
