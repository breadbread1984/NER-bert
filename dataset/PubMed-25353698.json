In this study, we analyzed gene mutations in four X-linked PID pedigrees, which include one X- linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) pedigree, one X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (XCGD) pedigree, and two X-linked Hyper IgM syndrome (XHIGM) pedigrees. Sequence analysis of the BTK gene revealed a novel mutation (c.1802_1803delinsGCC, p.Phe601CysfsX3) which results in the developmental arrest of B cells in the bone marrow. Sequence analysis of the CYBB gene revealed a recurrent frameshift mutation (c.1313_1314delinsT) in exon 10, which generates a premature stop codon (p.Lys438IlefsX63). One novel frameshift mutation (c.114delG, p.Ser39GlnfsX14) and one recurrent missense mutation (c.499G\u003EC, p.Gly167Arg) were found in the CD40LG gene and cause defective T cell functioning. In conclusion, our study identified two novel mutations on the BTK and CD40LG genes in Chinese patients and established accurate and simple genetic diagnostic methods for three X-linked PID.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":92,"end":125},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":518,"end":521},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":554,"end":574},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":599,"end":606},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":614,"end":645},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":691,"end":695},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":743,"end":761},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":781,"end":790},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":793,"end":807},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":865,"end":874},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":930,"end":938},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":971,"end":977},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":993,"end":1002},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1003,"end":1021},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T12"}]}
