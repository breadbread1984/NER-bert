We describe a homozygous novel missense mutation in the HOXC13 gene that resulted in autosomal recessive PHNED in a Hispanic child. The mutation c.812A\u003EG (p.Gln271Arg) is located within the DNA-binding domain of the HOXC13 gene, cosegregates within the family, and is predicted to be maximally damaging. This is the first reported case of a missense HOXC13 mutation resulting in PHNED and the first reported case of PHNED identified in a North American family. Our findings illustrate the critical role of HOXC13 in human hair and nail development.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":36},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":40,"end":46},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":47,"end":55},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":76,"end":115},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":350,"end":358},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":366,"end":372},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":383,"end":394},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":415,"end":420},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":660,"end":666},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":667,"end":675},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":676,"end":688},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":689,"end":694},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"}]}
