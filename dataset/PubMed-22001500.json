RTT diagnosis is based on distinct clinical criteria. We describe here a female patient with severe phenotype of congenital variant RTT. The patient originally presented with severe developmental delay prior to the age of 6 months and later exhibited characteristic features of RTT that included air swallowing, bruxism, and hand stereotypies. Results of an array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis indicated there was a very small microdeletion in Xq28. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis further confirmed there were heterozygous deletions of intron 2, exon 3, intron 3, and part of exon 4 in MECP2. Findings in the present patient confirm the view that large MECP2 deletions are an important cause of severe congenital variant RTT. To ensure an accurate diagnosis of congenital variant RTT, a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of MECP2 should be performed in patients suspected of having this disorder.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":82,"end":95},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":906,"end":911},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":912,"end":921},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":939,"end":944},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":974,"end":977},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"}]}
