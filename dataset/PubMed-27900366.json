Presently, the only known etiology is germline PTEN mutation. We report a 41-yr-old white female diagnosed with LDD and wild-type for PTEN. Exome sequencing revealed a germline heterozygous EGFR mutation that breaks a disulfide bond in the receptor's extracellular domain, resulting in constitutive activation. Functional studies demonstrate activation of ERK/AKT signaling pathways, mimicking PTEN loss-of-function downstream effects. The identification of EGFR as a candidate LDD susceptibility gene contributes to advancement of molecular diagnosis and targeted therapy for this rare condition with limited treatment options.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":34,"end":50},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":51,"end":55},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":56,"end":64},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":82,"end":106},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":108,"end":132},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":245,"end":253},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":266,"end":270},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":271,"end":279},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":409,"end":413},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":414,"end":422},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":428,"end":434},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":437,"end":490},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":505,"end":517},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":518,"end":528},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":561,"end":571},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":575,"end":601},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":613,"end":617},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":618,"end":634},"obj":"NegReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"}]}
