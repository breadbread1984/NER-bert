We report a case with an uncommon phenotype of late-onset myopathy without episodic paralytic attacks. Initial work-up including muscle biopsy was inconclusive. A subsequent review of the right deltoid biopsy, long exercise testing and repeated family history was helpful, followed by appropriate genetic testing. We identified a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in calcium ion channel (CACNA1S:c.1583G\u003EA\u2009p.Arg528His) causing hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. Myopathy can present without episodic paralysis and the frequency of paralytic episodes does not correlate well with the development and progression of a fixed myopathy. Our report also highlights the intrafamilial phenotypic variation of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis secondary to a CACNA1S gene mutation.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":575,"end":582},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":583,"end":604},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":606,"end":613},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":614,"end":645},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":886,"end":917},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":928,"end":930},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":933,"end":940},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":946,"end":954},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"}]}
