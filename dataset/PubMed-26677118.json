Objective To present clinical and histological findings in six children with a molecular diagnosis of LGMD2A and additionally the MRI findings in two of them. Method We retrospectively assessed medical records of 6 patients with mutation on CAPN3 gene. Results All patients were female (three to 12 years). The mean of age of disease onset was 9 years. All of them showed progressive weakness with predominance in lower limbs. Other findings were scapular winging, joint contractures and calf hypertrophy. One female had a more severe phenotype than her dizygotic twin sister that was confirmed by muscle MRI. Muscle biopsies showed a dystrophic pattern in all patients. Conclusion In this cohort of children with LGMD2A, the clinical aspects were similar to adults with the same disorder.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":82,"end":132},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":142,"end":151},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":152,"end":161},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":165,"end":170},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"}]}
