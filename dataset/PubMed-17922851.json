We report here a patient who died from severe lethal hypophosphatasia, who was compound heterozygous for the mutation c.1133A\u003ET (D361V) and the newly detected missense mutation c791A\u003EG, and whose parents were both healthy. Because the c.1133A\u003ET (D361V) mutation was previously reported to have a dominant-negative effect and to be responsible for the uncommon perinatal benign form of the disease, we studied the expression of the ALPL gene in this family. Analysis at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level, both quantitative and qualitative, showed that the paternal c.1133A\u003ET (D361V) mutation was associated with over-expression of the ALPL gene and that the maternal c.791A\u003EG mutation lead to complete skipping of exon 7. The results provide an explanation of the lethal phenotype in the patient where the two ALPL alleles are non-functional and in the asymptomatic father where over-expression of the normal allele could counteract the effect of the c.1133A\u003ET (D361V) mutation by providing an increased level of normal mRNA. This may also explain the variable expression of hypophosphatasia observed in parents of patients with the perinatal benign form.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":141,"end":157},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":191,"end":200},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":201,"end":210},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":256,"end":260},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":909,"end":918},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":956,"end":960},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":961,"end":971},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":979,"end":983},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1011,"end":1019},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1029,"end":1036},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1064},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"}]}
