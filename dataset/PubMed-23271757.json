Monozygous Qatari twins presented with an unusual perinatal manifestation characterized by severe muscular hypotonia, scarce spontaneous movements, multiple contractures, and respiratory insufficiency. Biochemical investigations suggested aspartylglucosaminuria, and a novel homozygous mutation c.439T\u003EC (p.S147P) was found in the aspartylglucosaminidase gene. However, it cannot be excluded that the unusual neonatal presentation is due to an additional autosomal recessive disease in this multiply consanguineous family. The classical aspartylglucosaminuria phenotype (progressive speech delay, psychomotor retardation, and behavioral abnormalities) was observed in 3 Turkish siblings. Although aspartylglucosaminuria was suspected early, the definite diagnosis was not confirmed until the age of 18 years. A novel homozygous mutation c.346C\u003ET (p.R116W) was found. These 5 cases emphasize that aspartylglucosaminuria is panethnic and may possibly present with prenatal manifestation. Screening for aspartylglucosaminuria should be done in all patients with unexplained psychomotor retardation.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":22},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":70,"end":74},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":83,"end":111},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":112,"end":120},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":523,"end":532},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":533,"end":555},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":589,"end":597},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":625,"end":653},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T11"}]}
