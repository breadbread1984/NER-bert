Lack of a C5a inhibitor activity in the peritoneum has previously been proposed in part to contribute in propagation of the serosal inflammation in FMF attacks. The aim of this study is to investigate C5a receptor (C5aR) gene polymorphism in patients with FMF and its relation to the main features of the disease. A polymorphism in the coding region of C5aR gene leading to C to T transition at nucleotide position 450 has been investigated in 85 non-related Turkish FMF patients and 160 non-related healthy controls by using PCR-RFLP. The frequencies of C5aR gene 450 CT genotype and T allele were not significantly different between Turkish FMF patients and healthy subjects (14.12 and 8.24% for FMF vs. 10 and 5% for controls, respectively). C5aR gene 450 CT genotype tended to associate with the presence Henoch-Schonlein purpura (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.917-1.704, P = 0.017) but with no other clinical findings of the disease. C5aR polymorphism might be searched in populations having high prevalence of FMF.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":111,"end":139},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":208,"end":214},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":215,"end":219},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":225,"end":234},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"}]}
