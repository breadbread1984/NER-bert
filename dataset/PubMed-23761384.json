FLLD individuals usually express an impaired or non-functional LPL enzyme with low or absent triglyceride (TG) hydrolysis activity causing severe hypertriglyceridaemia. Here we report a case of FLLD in a 29-year-old man, who initially presented with eruptive cutaneous xanthomata, elevated plasma TG concentration but no other co-morbidities. Subsequent genetic testing of the patient revealed compound heterozygosity of a novel duplication (p.R44Kfs*4) leading to a premature stop codon in exon 2 and a known mutation (N291S) in exon 5 of the LPL gene. Further biochemical analysis of the patient's postheparin plasma confirmed a reduction of total lipase activity compared with his heterozygous father carrying the common N291S mutation and to a healthy control. Also the patient showed increased (1.85-fold) activity of hepatic lipase (HL), indicating a functional link between HL and LPL. In summary, we report a case of FLLD caused by compound heterozygosity of a new duplication and a common mutation in the LPL gene, resulting in residual LPL activity. With such mutations, individuals may not receive a diagnosis before classical FLLD symptoms appear later in adulthood. Nevertheless, early diagnosis and lipid-lowering treatment may favour a reduced risk of premature cardiovascular disease or acute pancreatitis in such individuals.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":38},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":131,"end":136},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":138,"end":140},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":145,"end":168},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":170,"end":214},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":269,"end":278},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":315,"end":324},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":332,"end":335},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":784,"end":794},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":796,"end":806},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":809,"end":823},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":862,"end":867},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":886,"end":889},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":973,"end":982},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":992,"end":998},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":999,"end":1007},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1071},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1131,"end":1140},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1153,"end":1161},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1165,"end":1179},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1267,"end":1271},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1272,"end":1281},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1315,"end":1326},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1340,"end":1348},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1356,"end":1359},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1379,"end":1387},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1388,"end":1391},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1392,"end":1400},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T27"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T27","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T26","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R18","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R19","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R20","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R21","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R22","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R23","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R24","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R25","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T28","obj":"T29"},{"id":"R26","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T29","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"}]}
