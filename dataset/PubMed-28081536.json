DDS patients usually present heterozygous de novo germline WT1 mutations. The WT1 gene comprises 10 exons encoding the N-terminal transactivation and the C-terminal DNA-binding regions. Two unrelated patients with genital ambiguity and Wilms' tumor were analyzed by sequencing of the WT1 gene, and 3 mutations in exon 1 were identified of which 2 are novel. Patient 1 carried a c.555delC mutation that causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon. Patient 2 carried both c.421A\u003EC and c.424C\u003ET aberrations that lead to the missense p.Lys141Gln and the nonsense p.Lys142* mutation, respectively. As both patients were heterozygous for the mutations, we tested their parents who did not carry any mutation. Therefore, the 3 WT1 mutations occurred de novo in both patients. Heterozygous mutations result in WT1 haploinsufficiency as they impair protein production. They are associated with a milder DDS phenotype as observed in the patients studied here.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":102,"end":122},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":242,"end":249},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":280,"end":283},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":284,"end":293},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":599,"end":608},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":623,"end":629},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":632,"end":642},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":649,"end":663},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":694,"end":702},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":707,"end":715},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":733,"end":740},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":754,"end":765},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":783,"end":792},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1006,"end":1015},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1026,"end":1029},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1057,"end":1063},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1064,"end":1071},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1072,"end":1082},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T11"}]}
