Primarily, mutations in LMNA have been associated to the autosomal forms of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, a rare slowly progressive humero-peroneal muscular dystrophy accompanied by early contractures and dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects. LMNA mutations have been reported to be responsible for up to 10 distinct phenotypes that affect specifically either the skeletal and/or cardiac muscle, the adipose tissue, the peripheral nervous tissue, the bone tissue or more recently premature ageing. So far more than 180 different LMNA mutations have been identified in 903 individuals. The first studies of phenotype/genotype relationships revealed no dear relation between the phenotype and the type and/or the localization of the mutation, except perhaps for the globular tail domain of lamins A/C. Studies of the consequences of LMNA mutations in the skin cultured fibroblasts from the patients reveal abnormal nuclei in variable proportions, with dysmorphic nuclei exhibiting abnormal patterns of expression of B-type lamins and emerin. Finally, the development of KO and KI LMNA mice, will certainly give further insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with LMNA mutations. For example, Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice harbour phenotypes reminiscent of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":159,"end":168},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":172,"end":176},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":187,"end":200},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":224,"end":257},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}]}
