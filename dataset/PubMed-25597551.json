This condition affects 1 in 10\u00a0000 men and 1 in 50\u00a0000 women. Defects in seventeen genes including KAL1 gene contribute to the molecular basis of KS. We report the clinical characteristics, molecular causes and treatment outcome of two Chinese brothers with KS and X-linked ichthyosis. The phenotypes of the patients were characterised by bilateral cryptorchidism, unilateral renal agenesis in one patient but normal kidney development in another. The patients had low serum testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone levels and a blunt response to the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test. After human chorionic gonadotrophin treatment, the serum testosterone levels were normalized, and the pubic hair, penis length and testicular volumes were greatly improved in both of the patients. The two affected siblings had the same novel deletion at Xp22.3 including exons 9-14 of KAL1 gene and entire STS gene. Our study broadens the mutation spectrum in the KAL1 gene associated with KS and facilitates the genetic diagnosis and counselling for KS.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":6,"end":25},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":39,"end":43},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":55,"end":58},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":59,"end":64},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":65,"end":82},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":87,"end":106},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1245,"end":1253},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1270,"end":1274},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1280,"end":1295},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1296,"end":1298},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"}]}
