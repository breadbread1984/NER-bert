The homozygous genotypes represent the predominant format among our patients representing approximately 38% of the revealed genotypes. Interestingly, in 94 (31.4%) of the tested subjects, only one mutation in the pyrin gene could be identified while the other mutant allele remains unidentified. Moreover, the genotype of 3 (1%) patients revealed the presence of triplet mutations in the pyrin gene.\nCONCLUSION: The results of our study clearly suggest that the origin of FMF among the Palestinian population is mostly homozygous. The identification of a significant number of patients with one known mutation indicates potentially the presence of new mutations in the gene which will be investigated in the future.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":133,"end":142},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":164,"end":169},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":175,"end":177},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":178,"end":206},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"}]}
