We examined the association between CYP21A2 mutations and virilization (Prader score) in females with CAH. The study population included 187 CAH females with fully characterized CYP21A2 mutations. One hundred fifty-eight patients were sorted into groups by expected enzyme activity (percent of normal activity) of the less severely affected allele: (A) null, 0%; (B) I2G, 1%; (C) I172N, 2%; and (D) V281L, \u003E2%. We observed an inverse relationship between virilization and residual enzyme activity (P \u003C 0.001). Subjects in group A or B had a significantly higher likelihood (unadjusted odds ratio: 16; P \u003C 0.001) of developing severe virilization compared with those in group C. Surprisingly, 24% of group D patients, whose mutation is usually associated with nonclassical (NC) CAH, had severe virilization. Among subjects with the NC P30L mutation, 66% expressed unexpected virilization. Virilization, usually leading to extensive reconstructive surgery, is highly likely in patients with null or I2G mutations; however, NC mutations (P30L/V281L) may also lead to unexpected virilization. These findings have implications for prenatal counseling and highlight the need for additional investigations into other factors that influence virilization in CAH.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":95,"end":104},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":108,"end":115},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":125,"end":133},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":134,"end":148},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":149,"end":157},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":162,"end":171},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":223,"end":253},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":402,"end":405},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":414,"end":418},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":439,"end":446},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":447,"end":456},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"}]}
