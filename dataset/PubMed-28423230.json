Here, we report that GOF p53 induces tumorigenicity through simultaneous activation of key oncogenic pathways including those controlling putative tumor-initiating cell functions. We determined that in cells expressing p53-R273H, GOF p53 simultaneously upregulates genes from multiple signaling pathways by recognizing promoters containing distinct transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Our analytical data support a model in which GOF p53 complexes with two TFs on the promoter-a mediator protein, Med17, and a histone acetyl transferase, activating histone acetylation-and enhances gene expression to signal cell proliferation and oncogenesis. Thus, therapeutic inhibition of one GOF p53-induced pathway would be insufficient to prevent tumor growth as the oncoprotein activates a multitude of parallel pathways. This discovery suggests enormous selection advantage for cancer cells with GOF p53 to induce oncogenic growth, highlighting the problems of cancer therapy.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":0,"end":16},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":17,"end":20},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":21,"end":30},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":40,"end":58},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":62,"end":68},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":69,"end":81},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":85,"end":96},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":104,"end":120},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":127,"end":134},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":138,"end":141},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":142,"end":152},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":153,"end":158},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":159,"end":169},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":173,"end":191},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":196,"end":207},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":230,"end":233},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":234,"end":237},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":282,"end":292},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":296,"end":318},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":428,"end":431},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":432,"end":437},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":462,"end":473},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":485,"end":512},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":644,"end":647},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":648,"end":651},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":752,"end":762},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":763,"end":782},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":787,"end":795},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":796,"end":811},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R18","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R19","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R20","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T27","obj":"T26"},{"id":"R21","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T26","obj":"T28"},{"id":"R22","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T29","obj":"T28"},{"id":"R23","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T26","obj":"T30"},{"id":"R24","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T31","obj":"T30"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"}]}
