We present the clinical and follow-up findings of two kindreds with NR0B1 mutations. The proband of kindred A had a diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency when he was a newborn. Family history was relevant for a maternal uncle death at the newborn age. Beyond 2 year-old steroid measurements rendered undetectable and delayed bone age was noticed. Molecular analysis of NR0B1 gene revealed a previously unreported mutation (c.1084A\u003ET), leading to a premature stop codon, p.Lys362*, in exon 1. His mother and sister were asymptomatic carriers. At 14 year-old he had 3 mL of testicular volume and biochemical surveys (LH \u003C 0.1 UI/L, total testosterone \u003C 10 ng/dL) concordant with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. Kindred B had two males diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency at the newborn age. By 3 year-old both siblings had undetectable androgen levels and delayed bone age. NR0B1 molecular analysis identified a nonsense mutation in both cases, c.243C\u003EG; p.Tyr81*, in exon 1. Their mother and sister were asymptomatic carriers. At 14 year-old (Tanner stage 1) hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis evaluation in both males (LH \u003C 0.1UI/L, total testosterone \u003C 10 ng/dL) confirmed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In conclusion, biochemical profiles, bone age and an X-linked inheritance led to suspicion of NR0B1 mutations. Two nonsense mutations were detected in both kindreds, one previously unreported (c.1084A\u003ET; p.Lys362*). Mutation identification allowed the timely institution of testosterone in patients at puberty and an appropriate genetic counselling for relatives.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":0,"end":37},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":92,"end":96},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":105,"end":110},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":111,"end":119},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":121,"end":158},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":190,"end":211},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":235,"end":264},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":281,"end":290},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":291,"end":300},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":304,"end":309},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":690,"end":695},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":744,"end":753},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":756,"end":766},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":791,"end":799},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"}]}
