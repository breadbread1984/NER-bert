Here, we describe 11 individuals with IAHSP, aged 2-48\u00a0years, with IAHSP from three unrelated consanguineous Iranian families carrying the homozygous c.1640+1G\u003EA founder mutation in ALS2. Three affected siblings from one family exhibit generalized dystonia which has not been previously described in families with IAHSP and has only been reported in three unrelated consanguineous families with JALS/ALS2. We report the oldest individuals with IAHSP to date and provide evidence that these patients survive well into their late 40s with preserved cognition and normal eye movements. Our study delineates the phenotypic spectrum of IAHSP and ALS2-related disorders and provides valuable insights into the natural disease course.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":139,"end":158},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":212,"end":216},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":223,"end":228},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":310,"end":364},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":374,"end":408},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":421,"end":459},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":473,"end":482},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":483,"end":557},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":626,"end":631},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":685,"end":693},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":709,"end":720},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":741,"end":745},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"}]}
