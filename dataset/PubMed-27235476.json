It is well accepted that mutant p53 shows an oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) activity that facilitates the transformed phenotype of cancer cells. In addition, a growing body of evidence supports the notion that cancer stem cells comprise a seminal constituent in the initiation and progression of cancer development. Here, we elaborate on the mutant p53 oncogenic GOF leading toward the acquisition of a transformed phenotype, as well as placing mutant p53 as a major component in the establishment of cancer stem cell entity. Therefore, therapy targeted toward cancer stem cells harboring mutant p53 is expected to pave the way to eradicate tumor growth and recurrence.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":224,"end":230},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":231,"end":234},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":291,"end":302},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":307,"end":344},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":543,"end":549},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":550,"end":553},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":564,"end":567},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":583,"end":625},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T9"}]}
