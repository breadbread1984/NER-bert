The genomic abnormalities leading to NPC pathogenesis remain unclear. In total, 135 NPC tumors were examined to characterize the mutational landscape using whole-exome sequencing and targeted resequencing. An APOBEC cytidine deaminase mutagenesis signature was revealed in the somatic mutations. Noticeably, multiple loss-of-function mutations were identified in several NF-\u03baB signaling negative regulators NFKBIA, CYLD, and TNFAIP3 Functional studies confirmed that inhibition of NFKBIA had a significant impact on NF-\u03baB activity and NPC cell growth. The identified loss-of-function mutations in NFKBIA leading to protein truncation contributed to the altered NF-\u03baB activity, which is critical for NPC tumorigenesis. In addition, somatic mutations were found in several cancer-relevant pathways, including cell cycle-phase transition, cell death, EBV infection, and viral carcinogenesis. These data provide an enhanced road map for understanding the molecular basis underlying NPC.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":794,"end":810},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":811,"end":820},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":824,"end":830},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":842,"end":860},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":880,"end":887},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":888,"end":893},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":894,"end":902},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"}]}
