In the majority of clinically defined cases, mutations have been identified in the gene encoding cartilage algometric matrix protein (COMP).\nMETHODS: Five patients were included in the study. Linkage analysis and mutation analysis of the COMP gene were conducted in the patients and their family members.\nRESULTS: We have identified a novel mutation in axon 14 of COMP gene in the family.\nCONCLUSIONS: This mutation produced a severe MED phenotype with marked short stature, early onset osteoarthritis, and remarkable radiographic changes. Our results extended the range of disease-causing mutations in COMP gene and contributed more information about relationship between mutations and phenotype.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":14,"end":28},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":93,"end":97},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":98,"end":127},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":141,"end":169},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":247,"end":249},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":292,"end":301},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":381,"end":385},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T9"}]}
