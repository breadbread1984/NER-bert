All the 11 coding exons and the flanking intron sequences of GNE gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Four family members of case 5 were also examined for GNE gene mutations.\nRESULTS: All the patients were identified to have different GNE gene mutations: Cases 1-4 had complex heterozygous mutations and case 5 had homozygous mutation. Six reported mutations had been identified, including 1 nonsense mutation (p.R8X) and 5 missense mutations (p.D176V, p.I298T, p.A591T, P.A631V, and p.V696M). A novel mutation (c.317T\u003EC, p.I106T) was identified in case 2.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first report of p.R8X, p.I298T, p.A591T and p.V696M mutations in GNE gene in Chinese population, and a novel mutation p.I106T was identified. These findings further expand the clinical and genetic spectrum of DMRV in China.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1,"end":4},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":10,"end":18},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":42,"end":46},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":47,"end":83},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":898,"end":903},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":905,"end":912},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":914,"end":921},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":926,"end":933},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":947,"end":950},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1000,"end":1007},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1088,"end":1090},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1091,"end":1095},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T12"}]}
