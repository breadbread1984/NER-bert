In Ashkenazi Jews, two factor XI gene mutations Glu 117X (type II) and Phe283Leu (type III) are particularly common. In other ethnic groups, factor XI deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder and is related to a variety of mutations throughout the factor XI gene. Three cases of quantitative factor XI deficiency in relation with four novel missense mutations are reported: a compound heterozygosity for two novel mutations (Ala 181 Val and Ala 412 Thr) with a severe factor XI deficiency and two missense mutations (His 388 Pro and Trp 407 Cys) in heterozygous patients with partial factor XI deficiency.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":11,"end":14},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":20,"end":29},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":30,"end":32},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":39,"end":59},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":362,"end":382},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":418,"end":428},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":442,"end":451},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":467,"end":476},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":644,"end":655},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":660,"end":671},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":736,"end":747},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":752,"end":763},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":765,"end":767},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":803,"end":823},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T14"}]}
