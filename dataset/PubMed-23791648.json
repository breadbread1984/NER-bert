Here, we report the molecular findings from monozygotic twins, clinically diagnosed with tooth-specific odontohypophosphatasia (odonto-HPP). Sequencing of ALPL identified two genetic alterations in the probands, including a heterozygous missense mutation c.454C\u003ET, leading to change of arginine 152 to cysteine (p.R152C), and a novel heterozygous gene deletion c.1318_1320delAAC, leading to the loss of an asparagine residue at codon 440 (p.N440del). Clinical identification of low serum TNAP activity, dental abnormalities, and pedigree data strongly suggests a genotype-phenotype correlation between p.N440del and odonto-HPP in this family. Computational analysis of the p.N440del protein structure revealed an alteration in the tertiary structure affecting the collagen-binding site (loop 422-452), which could potentially impair the mineralization process. Nevertheless, the probands (compound heterozygous: p.[N440del];[R152C]) feature early-onset and severe odonto-HPP phenotype, whereas the father (p.[N440del];[=]) has only moderate symptoms, suggesting p.R152C may contribute or predispose to a more severe dental phenotype in combination with the deletion. These results assist in defining the genotype-phenotype associations for odonto-HPP, and further identify the collagen-binding site as a region of potential structural importance for TNAP function in the biomineralization.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":83,"end":99},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":153,"end":162},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":163,"end":172},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":176,"end":180},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":495,"end":503},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":505,"end":515},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":552,"end":559},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":601,"end":618},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":620,"end":630},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":679,"end":688},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":913,"end":922},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":953,"end":963},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":971,"end":989},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":990,"end":999},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1025},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1072},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1077,"end":1099},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"}]}
