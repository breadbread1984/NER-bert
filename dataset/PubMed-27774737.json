The recent functional characterization of disease-causing mutations described in patients with PMM2-CDG led to the idea of a therapeutic strategy involving pharmacological chaperones (PC) to rescue PMM2 loss-of-function mutations. The present work describes the high-throughput screening, by differential scanning fluorimetry, of 10,000 low-molecular-weight compounds from a commercial library, to search for possible PCs for the enzyme PMM2. This exercise identified eight compounds that increased the thermal stability of PMM2. Of these, four compounds functioned as potential PCs that significantly increased the stability of several destabilizing and oligomerization mutants and also increased PMM activity in a disease model of cells overexpressing PMM2 mutations. Structural analysis revealed one of these compounds to provide an excellent starting point for chemical optimization since it passed tests based on a number of pharmacochemical quality filters. The present results provide the first proof-of-concept of a possible treatment for PMM2-CDG and describe a promising chemical structure as a starting point for the development of new therapeutic agents for this severe orphan disease.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":69,"end":150},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":372,"end":380},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":475,"end":479},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":480,"end":496},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":497,"end":506},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"}]}
