We here describe two siblings with the same 11q23.3-qter deletion. Both parents were healthy with a normal karyotype. Cytogenetic microarray analysis revealed no mosaicism in either parent but the mother showed uniparental disomy encompassing the deleted region found in the two siblings. The pattern of X chromosome inactivation was almost completely skewed in the mother. These data suggested that the mother was a carrier of the 11q23.3-qter deletion but that this had been rescued by disomy formation during early embryogenesis except for her germinal cells.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":104,"end":121},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":153,"end":162},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":163,"end":171},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":175,"end":187},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}]}
