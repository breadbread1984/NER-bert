Exons 2, 3, and 4, in addition to intronic and 3'UTR adjacent regions, were sequenced in 80 patients with RS. Twenty-nine sequence variations were detected in 49 patients, 34 (69.4%) patients with the classic form of RS, and 15 (30.6%) patients with atypical forms of RS. Thirteen of the 29 detected mutations represent novel sequence variations. Missense mutation T158M was the most commonly observed mutation, detected in nine patients (11.2%). Six hotspot pathogenic mutations (R133C, T158M, R168X, R255X, R270X, and R294X) were responsible for the phenotype in 26/80 patients (32.5%).","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":106,"end":119},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":158,"end":167},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":168,"end":177},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":181,"end":186},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}]}
