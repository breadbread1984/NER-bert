The mutations are distributed throughout the protein in multiple functional domains. In biochemical and cell culture experiments, some mutant forms of GARS have been indistinguishable from wild-type protein, suggesting that these in vitro tests might not adequately assess the aberrant activity responsible for axonal degeneration. Recently, mouse and fly models have offered new insights into the disease mechanism. There are still gaps in our understanding of how mutations in a ubiquitously expressed component of the translation machinery result in axonal neuropathy. Here, we review recent reports, weigh the evidence for and against possible mechanisms and suggest areas of focus for future work.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":49,"end":84},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":121,"end":130},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":131,"end":140},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":168,"end":172},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"}]}
