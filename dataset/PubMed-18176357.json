Recently, a new pathway characterized by a biallelic mutation in the MYH gene, with a recessive model of inheritance was discovered for this inherited syndrome. This report describes a Tunisian patient with an attenuated FAP phenotype, presenting seven colon polyps and an adenocarcinoma but no detectable germline mutations in the FAP target genes. A well known somatic mutation was found in the APC mutation cluster region (MCR). This case shows that further studies are needed to fully understand all the pathways of the FAP syndrome.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":70,"end":100},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":111,"end":125},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":137,"end":146},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":149,"end":166},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":202,"end":205},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"}]}
