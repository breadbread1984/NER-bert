Regardless of the presence or absence of CTNNB1 mutations, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin is often observed in WTs with ectopic mesenchymal elements. Here, we addressed the relationship between the WNT-signalling pathway and lineage in WTs by examining CTNNB1 and WT1 mutations, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, tumour histology and gene expression profiles. In addition, we screened for mutations in WTX, which has been proposed to be a negative regulator of the canonical WNT-signalling pathway. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified two classes of tumours: mesenchymal lineage WNT-dependent tumours, and epithelial lineage WNT-independent tumours. In contrast to the mesenchymal lineage specificity of CTNNB1 mutations, WTX mutations were surprisingly observed in both lineages. WTX-mutant WTs with ectopic mesenchymal elements had nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, upregulation of WNT target genes and an association with CTNNB1 mutations in exon 7 or 8. However, epithelial lineage WTs with WTX mutations had no indications of active WNT signalling, suggesting that the involvement of WTX in the WNT-signalling pathway may be lineage dependent, and that WTX may have an alternative function to its role in the canonical WNT-signalling pathway.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":665,"end":674},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":678,"end":681},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":715,"end":723},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":751,"end":773},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1068},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1069,"end":1075},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1126,"end":1138},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1142,"end":1154},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1168},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1172,"end":1188},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1196,"end":1212},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1213,"end":1219},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1220,"end":1229},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T11"}]}
