Main outcome measures were genetic mutations, psychiatric profile, and their association.\nRESULTS: 23 mutations in ATP2A2 gene were scattered over the entire gene, 14 of them novel. Two families shared the same mutation. Twenty-one patients (28.3%) had a history of psychiatric disorder, most of them mood disorders; another 7 (9.4%) patients were highly suspected of having a psychiatric disorder; 21 (27.6%) reported suicidal thoughts; and 5 (6.6%) had attempted suicide. Psychiatric phenotype demonstrated inter- and intra-familial variability, and was not associated with disease severity, family history of psychiatric disease, or mutation location.\nCONCLUSIONS: The cohort demonstrated genetic heterogeneity with no mutation cluster along the gene, and high prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Although no clear genotype-phenotype correlation was found, the results point to a major effect of genetic background on psychiatric phenotype, together with other modifiers.
