DNA analysis of his blood of the UGT1A1 gene sequence demonstrated that he was homozygous for an insertion mutation causing a change of the coding exons with a frame-shift, resulting in the substitution of 27 abnormal amino acid residues in his hepatic bilirubin uridine diphosphoglucuronyl transferase enzyme. Both of his parents were heterozygous for the same mutation. A novel frame-shifting mutation of the UGT1A1 gene was found, confirming the diagnosis of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I for this patient.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":6,"end":20},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":33,"end":39},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":45,"end":51},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":52,"end":82},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}]}
