As tumors that develop in the context of VHL also occur in a sporadic context, the frequency of this syndrome may be underestimated. Our aim was to identify VHL gene mutations in Argentinian patients who fulfilled the clinical criteria for type 1 VHL disease and in patients with VHL-associated manifestations that did not meet these criteria.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study, including patients who met current diagnostic criteria for type 1 VHL (Group 1, n\u2009=\u200919) and patients with VHL-associated manifestations that did not meet these criteria (Group 2, n\u2009=\u200921). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. Mutation analysis involved DNA sequencing, while large deletions were determined by universal primer quantitative fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction (UPQFM-PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis.\nRESULTS: VHL mutations were detected in 16/19 (84.2%) patients in Group 1 and included: gross deletions (4/16); nonsense mutations (6/16); frameshift mutations (4/16); missense mutations (1/16); and splicing mutations (1/16). Three of these mutations were novel. No alterations were found in 3 of 19 VHL patients. In Group 2, one nonsense VHL mutation was detected in a young patient with a solitary central nervous system hemangioblastoma without familial history. A study of 30 first-degree relatives revealed four carriers with VHL mutations.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found three novel mutations in the VHL gene in our population. Our results emphasize the importance of a complete genetic study of VHL to confirm type 1 VHL disease, not only in patients with clinical diagnostic criteria but also in those presenting a single typical manifestation.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":147,"end":164},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":182,"end":191},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":192,"end":201},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":209,"end":212},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}]}
