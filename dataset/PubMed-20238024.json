The frequency of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is 1/3500 worldwide, however, in northern Sweden it is 1/2000 due to limited migration and a 'founder' effect. In this study we identified genetic mechanisms underlying autosomal dominant and recessive RP present in northern Sweden. Several novel mutations unique for this region were found. In an autosomal recessive form of RP, Bothnia dystrophy caused by mutations in the RLBP1 gene, bi-allelic mutations R234W, M226K and compound heterozygosity, M226K+R234W was detected.In dominant form of RP mapped to 19q13.42 a 59 kb genomic deletion including the PRPF31 and three other genes was found.These data provide additional information on the molecular mechanisms of RP evolvement and in the future might be useful in development of therapeutic strategies. Identification of the disease-causing mutations allowed introducing molecular genetic testing of the patients and their families into the clinical practice.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":572,"end":589},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":590,"end":599},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":600,"end":609},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":617,"end":622},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}]}
