Despite significant improvement in the treatment of T-ALL, approximately 20% of children and most adults undergo relapse. Previous findings demonstrated that loss of T-cell quiescence due to a mutation in the Slfn2 gene (elektra) leads to acquisition of an aberrant developmental program by which T-cells lose their renewal capabilities and undergo apoptosis. Here we show that the elektra mutation in Slfn2 completely prevents a severe lymphoproliferative disease caused by overexpression of BCL2 in combination with Fas deficiency in mice. Moreover, Slfn2 impaired-function protects mice from experimental disease similar to human T-ALL by severely impairing the proliferation potential and survival of leukemic T-cells, partially by activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Our study suggest that in certain malignancies, such as T-ALL, a novel therapeutic strategy may be applied by imposing aberrant development of leukemic cells. Furthermore, as the elektra mutation in Slfn2 seems to impair only T-cells and monocytes, targeting Slfn2 is expected to be harmless to other cell types, and thereby could be a promising target for treating malignancies. Together our results demonstrate the potential of targeting Slfn2 and its human paralog for T-ALL treatment.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":341,"end":345},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":349,"end":366},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":376,"end":384},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":392,"end":397},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":413,"end":421},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":440,"end":470},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":488,"end":492},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":499,"end":519},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":524,"end":541},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1154,"end":1162},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1166,"end":1171},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1181,"end":1187},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1193,"end":1200},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1205,"end":1214},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"}]}
