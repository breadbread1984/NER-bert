Initially, MeCP2 had been shown to be a repressor of gene transcription. In their 2008 paper, Chahrour and colleagues (DOI: 10.1126/science.1153252) reported that MeCP2 could also function as a transcriptional activator.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":42,"end":55},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":127,"end":136},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":137,"end":146},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":184,"end":189},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"}]}
