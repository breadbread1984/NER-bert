Here, we present an unusual case of UPD in congenital severe factor (F) XIII deficiency. A 6-year-old girl experienced cephalhematoma and umbilical bleeding after birth and easy bruising, and postextraction bleeding since early infancy. FXIII activity was 0% [mother 53.7% and father 132.5% (normal 70-140%)] and the FXIII antigen level was 2.5% [mother 38.9% and father 151% (normal 75-155%)]. The washed platelet FXIII activity was 0.1% in the patient (normal 64-144%), suggesting a deficiency of FXIII-A subunit. The FXIII-A subunit genetic analysis detected a homozygous p.Arg382Ser mutation. A similar heterozygous mutation was detected in the mother but surprisingly, not in the father. Kinship was confirmed by a paternity test. To confirm the possibility of UPD, a test using four markers in the vicinity of the F13A1 gene revealed that she inherited duplicate mutations from a heterozygous mutation in her mother, presenting a unique case of unusual maternal segmental UPD in otherwise unexplained congenital (homozygous) severe FXIII deficiency. UPD as a rare cause of autosomal recessive bleeding disorder when only one parent is affected is critical for genetic counseling.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":142,"end":160},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1113,"end":1118},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1152,"end":1171},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1236,"end":1243},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1271,"end":1274},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1331,"end":1347},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T5"}]}
