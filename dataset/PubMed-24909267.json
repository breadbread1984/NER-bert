Recently, ADG was found to be caused in one family by a mutation in SMARCAD1, a member of the SNF subfamily of the helicase protein superfamily.\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the genetic basis of ADG.\nMETHODS: We used direct sequencing and global gene expression analysis.\nRESULTS: We identified three novel heterozygous mutations in SMARCAD1 (c.378 + 2T \u003E C, c.378 + 5G \u003E C and c.378 + 1G \u003E A) in a total of six patients. Surprisingly, all four ADG-causing mutations identified to date disrupt a single conserved donor splice site adjacent to the 3' end of a noncoding exon and are predicted to result in haploinsufficiency for a skin-specific isoform of SMARCAD1. These data indicate a pivotal role for the SMARCAD1-skin specific isoform in dermatoglyph formation. In order to better understand the consequences of ADG-associated mutations, we ascertained the global transcription profiles of primary keratinocytes downregulated for SMARCAD1 and of patient-derived keratinocytes. A total of eight genes were found to be differentially expressed in both patient-derived and knocked down keratinocytes. Of interest, these differentially expressed genes have been implicated in epidermal ontogenesis and differentiation, and in psoriasis, which is characterized by abnormal finger ridge patterns.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest that ADG is genetically homogeneous and result from perturbed expression of epidermal differentiation-associated genes.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":9},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":13,"end":21},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":22,"end":27},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":28,"end":62},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":67,"end":74},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":79,"end":89},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":704,"end":713},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":733,"end":740},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":743,"end":777},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":852,"end":870},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":877,"end":898},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":902,"end":910},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"}]}
