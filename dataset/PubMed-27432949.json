All characterized P4-ATPases flip glycerophospholipids across the bilayer to the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane, but how these enzymes distinguish glycerophospholipids from sphingolipids is not known. We used a directed evolution approach to examine the molecular mechanisms through which P4-ATPases discriminate substrate backbone. A mutagenesis screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has identified several gain-of-function mutations in the P4-ATPase Dnf1 that facilitate the transport of a novel lipid substrate, sphingomyelin. We found that a highly conserved asparagine (N220) in the first transmembrane segment is a key enforcer of glycerophospholipid selection, and specific substitutions at this site allow transport of sphingomyelin.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":749,"end":765},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":766,"end":775},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":783,"end":792},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":803,"end":813},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":818,"end":827},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"}]}
