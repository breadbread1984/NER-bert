This enzyme is made up of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits encoded by SUCLG1 and SUCLA2, respectively. We present a child with severe muscular hypotonia, dystonia, failure to thrive, sensorineural deafness, and dysmorphism. Metabolic investigations disclosed hyperlactacidemia, moderate urinary excretion of methylmalonic acid, and elevated levels of C4-dicarboxylic carnitine in blood. We identified a novel homozygous p.M329V in SUCLA2. In cultured cells, the p.M329V resulted in a reduced amount of the SUCLA2 protein, impaired production of mitochondrial ATP, and enhanced production of reactive oxygen species, which was partially reduced by using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide in the culture medium. Expanding the array of SUCLA2 mutations, we suggested that reactive oxygen species scavengers are likely to impact on disease prognosis.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":8,"end":14},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":15,"end":23},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":57,"end":61},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":69,"end":91},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":746,"end":752},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":777,"end":784},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":799,"end":806},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":807,"end":813},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":821,"end":827},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":828,"end":835},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":837,"end":845},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":846,"end":877},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":883,"end":891},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":892,"end":929},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"}]}
