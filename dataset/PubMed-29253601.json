Though the etiology is elusive, strong evidence for a genetic contribution to TS has been established. To date, various chromosomal or genetic alterations have been implicated in its pathogenesis. Recently, the deletion in the arylacetamide deacetylase gene (AADAC) was reported to be associated with TS. To investigate the association between the AADAC gene variants and TS, we conducted genetic analysis of the AADAC gene in 200 Han Chinese patients and 300 ethnicity-matched normal controls. Two variants, including a heterozygous splice-site variant, c.361\u202f+\u202f1G\u202f\u003E\u202fA (rs762169706), and a missense variant, c.744A\u202f\u003E\u202fT (p.R248S, rs186388618), were identified in two unrelated patients. The c.361\u202f+\u202f1G\u202f\u003E\u202fA variant, absent in 300 ethnicity-matched controls, led to the deletion of exon 2 in AADAC mRNA, probably associated with development of TS. The c.744A\u202f\u003E\u202fT variant, predicted to be damaging, was identified in two normal controls. The findings indicate that the AADAC gene c.361\u202f+\u202f1G\u202f\u003E\u202fA variant may be a potential candidate factor for TS development, though further investigations are warranted.","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":77,"end":94},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":865,"end":879},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":931,"end":937},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":942,"end":950},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":985,"end":1000},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1018},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1140,"end":1145},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1151,"end":1165},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1193,"end":1209},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1214,"end":1216},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"}]}
