All subjects underwent clinical examination and laboratory tests. Mutation screening of the TPO gene was performed by sequencing fragments amplified from extracted genomic DNA.\nRESULTS: The siblings were diagnosed as CGH with neurodevelopmental deficits. Two compound heterozygous inactivating mutations were found in the two patients: a frameshift mutation between positions 2268 and 2269 (c.2268-2269 insT) and a missense mutation at c.2089 G\u003EA (p.G667S) of the TPO gene. Their parents, with normal thyroid hormone levels, were heterozygous for mutations c.2268-2269 insT and c.2089 G\u003EA, respectively. The polymorphisms of c.1207 G\u003ET, c.1283 G\u003EC, and c.2088 C\u003ET were detected in the family.\nCONCLUSIONS: CGH of the Chinese siblings was due to the TPO gene mutations (c.2268-2269 insT and c.2089 G\u003EA).","project":"AGAC_answer","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":154,"end":157},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":159,"end":168},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":169,"end":171},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":196,"end":230},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1024,"end":1027},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1056,"end":1062},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1067,"end":1070},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1087,"end":1103},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1108,"end":1118},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T6"}]}
